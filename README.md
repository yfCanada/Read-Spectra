# Read-Spectra

Spectral refelctance of two samples (sample#1535778, sample# 1535921 ) are measured by two different spectrometers (one in visible (VIS) and teh other in near infrared (NIR) range). There are 5 spectra measured for each sameple thus 10 files in each folder. Data files are saved as either txt or csv fomat. These two spectrometer stores data slightly difeerent. Two similar R scripts are written to go through all the data files in the folder and make a tidy data frame containing all the measured spectra (i.e. 10 files generate 10 spectra in the data frame).  Spectral reflectance of these 10 spectra are plotted all together, color coded by sample number (or by file names).
